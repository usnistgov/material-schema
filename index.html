    Material Schemas aims to support the implementation of FAIR Data Principles within the materials science and engineering community. Read more about the FAIR Data Principles:

    </ul>
    Material Schemas does this by encouraging the community to leverage and extend Schema.org in their web applications, to enable indexing by major search engines. The publication of consistent metadata could also enable harvesting by specialized discovery portals built by the community. This effort is inspired and informed by <a href="https://bioschemas.org/">Bioschemas</a>, in the life sciences community.

<h2>Schema.org</h2>
<p>
    <a href="https://schema.org/">Schema.org</a> is an industry-lead, voluntary consensus specification enabling the uniform representation of structured data on the internet and beyond.
</p>
<p>
    Websites and data providers have broadly implemented Schema.org markup in their webpages, which enables improved discovery on major search engines and specialized search tools, such as <a href="https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch">Google Dataset Search</a>.
